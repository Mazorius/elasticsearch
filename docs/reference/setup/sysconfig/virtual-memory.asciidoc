[[vm-max-map-count]]
=== Virtual memory

Elasticsearch uses a <<mmapfs,`mmapfs`>> directory by
default to store its indices.  The default operating system limits on mmap
counts is likely to be too low, which may result in out of memory exceptions.

On Linus, you can increase the limits by creating a `elasticsearch.conf` file 
under `/etc/sysctl.d/`.
Content of this file should be:

[source,sh]
-------------------------------------
vm.max_map_count=262144
-------------------------------------

Afterwards you should run the following command which will reload this config:

[source,sh]
-------------------------------------
sysctl --system
-------------------------------------
